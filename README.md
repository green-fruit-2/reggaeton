The aim of this project is to become well-versed in deep learning techniques, 
using Spanish music as the prime motivator. I anticipate key aspects of the project will include natural language generation,
visual and audio GANs, and possibly music generation (admittedly I have less
of an idea of what this will look like, but I do not foresee this being the task from
which I learn the most). This can become a SWE, in addition to a DL one.

It may be beneficial to add some tangential data visualizations to help viewers
understand how NLP works (ex; visualizing word embeddings with t-SNE).

<li>Someone on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ&t=358s">Medium</a> created a pop music generator
apparently alot of pop songs follow certain chord patterns.
</li>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/models">HuggingFace</a> has a set of language generation algorithms for the Spanish
 language; there's 14 of them and all of them were produced in 2021!

<li>Medium 
<a href="https://medium.com/motius-de/schlagerai-automatically-generating-pop-lyrics-using-language-models-39620d4f83ad">article</a> shows Spotify has a Web API I can use to scrape information about playlists, artists, and songs. 
A python library called Spotipy can also help. 
LyricsGenius (another Python library) can also help.</li>
